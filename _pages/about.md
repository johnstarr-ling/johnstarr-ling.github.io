Hey!
======
My name is John R. Starr.[^1] I'm a computational psycholinguist **currently looking for a post-doctoral or professor position**. Most of my work focuses on how people dynamically update their processing strategies according to the information that they've already received, though I am also interested in representational and behavioral analyses of language models (large or not). You can read more about my work by clicking the Publications and Presentations tab above. 

I'm currently a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University, where I am advised by [Dr. Marten van Schijndel](https://vansky.github.io/). I'm affiliated with the [Computational Psycholinguistics Discussion Group (C.Psyd)](https://c-psyd.github.io/), [Cornell NLP](https://nlp.cornell.edu/), the [Cornell Phonetics Lab (PLab)](https://conf.ling.cornell.edu/), and the [Linguistic Meaning Lab (LiMe)](https://lime-lab-cornell.github.io/). Additionally, I am currently one of two Student Representatives on the Executive Committee for the [Linguistic Society of America](https://www.lsadc.org/). Before coming to Cornell, I completed two BAs, one in English Writing (Poetry) and one in Linguistics, from the University of Pittsburgh. 

If you email me and I don't answer right away, I'm probably busy doing one of the following: skipping stones in local [creek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAGi71uHm4g)s or on Lake Cayuga, setting routes at the [local climbing gym in Ithaca](https://www.cayugaclimbs.com/), or napping with my cat Magnolia.

I'm originally from the suburbs of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, meaning \\(John \in  \\{ \,x\, \mid \, x\, is\, a\, jaded\, and\, delusional\, Philly\, sports\, fan \\} \\).

[^1]: Unfortunately, I am not related to the more famous [Ringo Starr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringo_Starr), [Patrick Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Star), [Antony Starr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Starr), or [the Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun).
